# EECS368-Programming-Language-Paradigms

EECS 368 at the University of Kansas (Spring 2016)

The course is a survey of programming languages: their attributes, uses, advantages, and disadvantages. Topics include scopes, parameter passing, storage management, control flow, exception handling, encapsulation and modularization mechanism, reusability through genericity and inheritance, and type systems. 

Several different languages such as JavaScript, PHP, Haskell and C++ will be studied which exemplify different language philosophies (e.g., procedural, functional, object-oriented, logic, scripting)
