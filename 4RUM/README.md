# Final project EECS 368: 4RUM

Logan Ayer and I, Vuong Nguyen built a small social networking site for general use. The users will be able to edit their profile after
signing up and write posts on an open forum. A administration user can view users and their posts as well as delete posts.

The app is currently hosted in our EECS Server at URL: http://people.eecs.ku.edu/~layer/4Rum/main.html

Work division: 
- Vuong was responsible for the initial setup of 4RUM, including database mysql, HTML and PHP.
- Logan built the front-end design, CSS styling and JavaScript functions.
